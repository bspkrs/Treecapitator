TreeCapitator:
ML Client: Latest Release (ML 1.4.6.r01) All Releases (<=1.4.5)
Forge: Latest Release (Forge 1.4.6.r01) All Releases (<=1.4.5) Dev Builds
Delete ALL previous versions of ANY TreeCapitator mods from your mods folder before using the new CoreMod version!  Put it in the coremods folder!
There is a conflict with Magic Launcher that makes it think there is a duplicate mod.  Disable TreeCapitator in Magic Launcher and drop the mod in the coremods folder.
MultiMine users: you MUST add the log block IDs you are using in TreeCapitator to the MultiMine block exclusion list found in AS_MultiMine.cfg.  Otherwise TreeCapitator will not work.
(Starting in Forge 1.4.5.r01, put the downloaded .jar file in .minecraft/coremods)

This makes so destroying a log block with an axe makes all the connected wood blocks above it fall as well. Based on Terraria tree-cutting style.

Features:
- Forge version can break any log out of the box (see logIDList config setting)
- Sneak while chopping to break logs normally (configurable)
- Configurable list of tool IDs to determine what an "axe" is
- optional item damage based on number of logs broken (defaults to enabled)
- Smart tree-detection
- option to destroy leaves (enabled by default)
- option to shear leaves (with a shear-type item in hotbar)
- option to shear vines (with a shear-type item in hotbar)
- disable drops in creative
- disable tool requirement
- mod version checking (never miss a new feature)

Some notes on how it works:[spoiler]Tree Detection
- Trees are determined by looking at the number of leaf blocks that neighbor the top block of a vertical column of logs.
- If the top block has 2 or more neighboring leaf blocks the code considers that column of logs to be a tree.
- If the top block does not have 2 neighboring leaf blocks the code will default to normal block breaking.
Item Damage
- Axes and Shears that have the Unbreaking enchantment will work the way they are supposed to.
- Damage is applied to the item as each block is broken in the chain.
- The allowMoreBlocksThanDamage setting should be self-explanitory, but basically it means that if it is set to false and your item breaks in the middle of chopping down a tree, the remaining blocks will not be broken.
- The code will not search for other axes in your hotbar to apply damage to if your current axe breaks.
- If you have multiple "shear-type" items in your hotbar, the code will always apply damage to the left-most item.
Destroying Leaves/Vines
- Shearing vines doesn't get every vine  It seems to favor vines hanging on the Western face of the tree.
- The destroyLeaves setting MUST be set to true in order for shearLeaves or shearVines to work.
- The shearLeaves and shearVines settings can be enabled independently of each other.
- Yes, sometimes a few leaf blocks are left behind after chopping a tree, but they will decay normally.[/spoiler]

ML/MLMP Configuration File (.minecraft/config/mod_treeCapitator.cfg):[spoiler][code]#allowUpdateCheck (boolean:true) -- Set to true to allow checking for mod updates, false to disable
#axeIDList (java.lang.String:271; 275; 258; 286; 279) -- IDs of items that can chop down trees. Use ',' to split item id from metadata and ';' to split items.
#needItem (boolean:true) -- Whether you need an item from the IDList to chop down a tree. Disabling will let you chop trees with any item.
#onlyDestroyUpwards (boolean:true) -- Setting this to false will allow the chopping to move downward as well as upward (and blocks below the one you break will be chopped)
#destroyLeaves (boolean:true) -- Enabling this will make leaves be destroyed when trees are chopped.
#shearLeaves (boolean:false) -- Enabling this will cause destroyed leaves to be sheared when a shearing item is in the hotbar (ignored if destroyLeaves is false).
#shearVines (boolean:false) -- Enabling this will shear /some/ of the vines on a tree when a shearing item is in the hotbar (ignored if destroyLeaves is false).
#shearIDList (java.lang.String:359) -- IDs of items that when placed in the hotbar will allow leaves to be sheared when shearLeaves is true. Use ',' to split item id from metadata and ';' to split items.
#logHardnessNormal (float:2.0) -- The hardness of logs for when you are using items that won't chop down the trees.
#logHardnessModified (float:4.0) -- The hardness of logs for when you are using items that can chop down trees.
#disableInCreative (boolean:false) -- Flag to disable tree chopping in Creative mode
#disableCreativeDrops (boolean:false) -- Flag to disable drops in Creative mode
#allowItemDamage (boolean:true) -- Enable to cause item damage based on number of blocks destroyed
#allowMoreBlocksThanDamage (boolean:false) -- Enable to allow chopping down the entire tree even if your item does not have enough damage remaining to cover the number of blocks.
#damageMultiplier (float:1.0) -- The damage your item takes will be multiplied by this decimal number, ie- if you set it to 0.5F, your item will only take half as much damage when chopping an entire tree versus breaking blocks normally, or if you use 2.0F it will cause twice as much damage per block broken.
#sneakAction (java.lang.String:disable) -- Set sneakAction = "disable" to disable tree chopping while sneaking, set sneakAction = "enable" to only enable tree chopping while sneaking.
#maxBreakDistance (int:10) -- The maximum horizontal distance that the log breaking algorithm will travel (use -1 for no limit).
